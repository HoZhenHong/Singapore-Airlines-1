                    Singapore Airlines Cargo (abbreviation: SIA Cargo) is the unit within Singapore Airlines (SIA) responsible for air cargo operations. It was incorporated in 1988.SIA Cargo manages the cargo operations of SIA's fleet of freight- and passenger aircraft. Its main office is on the fifth floor of the SATS Airfreight Terminal 5 at Singapore Changi Airport.Singapore Airlines has been in the cargo business for over 50 years. They first started the cargo operations flying the Airspeed Consuls in 1947. In July 1992, Singapore Airlines created a cargo division to complement its passenger-carrying business. However, it was not until 1 July 2001 that Singapore Airlines Cargo was incorporated, taking over the air-freight operations of Singapore Airlines as a separate subsidiary. SIA Cargo leased the entire freighter fleet from Singapore Airlines, as well as taking over management of the cargo holds in all of Singapore Airlines' passenger aircraft. Within a few months, it entered an alliance with Lufthansa Cargo and SAS Cargo Group to form WOW Alliance on 1 October 2001.SIA Cargo's warehouse in Singapore, dubbed SIA Superhub 1, was opened in 1995. This warehouse is capable of handling up to 450,000 tons of goods a year. In 2001, the SIA Superhub 2 was opened which increased the capacity to over 1,200,000 tonnes per year.In December 2008, Singapore Airlines Cargo was alleged by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) to be a participant in a price fixing cartel in the air cargo industry.As of 31 March 2018, Singapore Airlines Cargo offered dedicated Boeing 747-400 freighter services to 19 cities in 13 countries and territories, including Singapore.

                    Scoot Pte Ltd, operating as Scoot, is a Singaporean low-cost airline and a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines.It began its operations on 4 June 2012 on medium and long-haul routes from Singapore, predominantly to various airports throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Scoot's airline slogan is Escape the Ordinary.Scoot's fleet initially consisted of six Boeing 777-200ER aircraft previously operated by parent company Singapore Airlines until 2015, when the airline began to transition its long-haul fleet to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Scoot also uses the Airbus A320, inherited from Tigerair, another low-cost Singaporean airline which officially merged with Scoot on 25 July 2015, along with the Airbus A320neo and Airbus A321neo for its short-haul flights.
                    Tigerair was merged into Scoot to consolidate the low-cost airline business, where its operations were absorbed into Scoot with the use of Tigerair's air operator's certificate (AOC). With the change of AOC following the merger, Scoot's IATA code was changed to Tigerair's TR from TZ, and its ICAO code was changed to Tigerair's TGW from SCO. However, the Scoot brand and the Scooter callsign were retained. Its head office is at Changi Airport.2011–2013: Inception

                  <p>Singapore Airlines began with the incorporation of Malayan Airways Limited (MAL) on 1 May 1947, by the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool, the Straits Steamship Company of Singapore and Imperial Airways. The airline's first flight was a chartered flight from the British Straits Settlement of Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 2 April 1947 using an Airspeed Consul twin-engined aircraft.

                  <p>When Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from "Malayan Airways" to "Malaysian Airways". MAL also took over Borneo Airways. In 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and routes, including the purchase of MSA's first Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 707s, as well the completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. Boeing 737s were added to the fleet soon after.</p>

                <div class="modal-body">MSA ceased operations in 1972, and both Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System commenced operations in its place. The reason for this development was strategic: Singapore wanted to increase its international routes, but Malaysia wanted to develop its domestic network before moving on to international routes.Singapore Airlines kept all of MSA's Boeing 707s and 737s, and retained the international routes out of Singapore as well as the existing corporate headquarters in the city, with J.Y. Pillay, former joint chief of MSA, as its first chairperson. Female flight attendants continued to wear the sarong kebaya uniform, which had been first introduced in 1968. A local start-up advertising company, Batey Ads was given the right to market the airline, eventually selecting the sarong and kebaya-clad air stewardesses as an icon for the airline and calling them Singapore Girls.</p>

                  <p>Syonan (Japanese: 昭南, Hepburn: Shōnan, Kunrei-shiki: Syônan), officially Syonan Island (Japanese: 昭南島, Hepburn: Shōnan-tō, Kunrei-shiki: Syônan-tô), was the name for Singapore when it was occupied and ruled by the Empire of Japan, following the fall and surrender of British military forces on 15 February 1942 during World War II.
                    Japanese military forces occupied it after defeating the combined British, Indian, Australian, Malayan and the Straits Settlements garrison in the Battle of Singapore. The occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations, including those of Japan, Britain, and Singapore. Singapore was renamed Syonan-to, meaning "Light of the South Island" and was also included as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (Japanese: 大東亜共栄圏, Hepburn: Dai Tōa Kyōeiken).
                    Singapore was officially returned to British colonial rule on 12 September 1945, following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which lead to the formal signing of the surrender at the Municipal Building, currently known as City Hall. After the return of the British, there was growing political sentiments amongst the local populace in tandem with the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist fervor, as many felt that the British were no longer competent with the administration and defence of the crown colony and its inhabitants.</p>

                  <p>It was 1945 when Singapore separated from Malaysia, the Strait settlements were dissolved and Singapore moved towards independence. In 1954, the People's Action Party was formed and it drove the Singaporean politics rapidly to the extent that in 1955, a new constitution was introduced. In 1959, Singapore became a self-governing state under the British Government with the leader of the People's Action Party, Lee Kuan Yew taking over as the Prime Minister.
                    In August 1963, Singapore declared independence from the British rule and joined the federation of Malaysia along with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak. However, after ideological conflicts between the federation and the Singapore government's major political party, People's Action Party (PAP) Singapore also left the federation soon after due to race riots in 1965 and on 9th August in the same year gained sovereignty officially. Singapore became completely independent, and Yusof Bin Ishak was sworn in as its first president while Lee Kuan Yew continued as prime minister. 
                    The merger with Malaysia proved unsuccessful. Singapore left Malaysia and on 9 August 1965 became an independent and sovereign democratic nation. Even today, Singapore preserves the remnants of its multicultural, colonial and wartime past in the form of monuments, museums and memorials.</p>

The port of Singapore has surpassed the ports of Hong Kong and Rotterdam and is the world's busiest transhipment port today. The nation's medical to, as well as culinary tourism industries, have remarkably grown over the years becoming quite marketable - thankful of the advance medical technology and mosaic of cultural heritage.
                    .Apart from the significant growth in the banking sector and biotech industry, Singapore today is also the fifteenth largest trading partner of the United States. The effectiveness of the early-proposed economic business model is indeed commendable. Now,in 2023 Singapore holds world best airline and world best airport.</p>
